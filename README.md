# Assessing the habitability of exoplanets

In this paper, we examine detailed descriptions of planets and perform an assessment of their habitability. The analysis will be based on the methods taught and practiced in class, as well as independent research. Thus we demonstrate how to use the properties given; star/planet information, atmospheric composition, and other known values, to determine if that planet is capable of sustaining at least single celled life.

It is organised as follows
- inputs: contains the datasets used in the paper
- outputs: contains the paper pdf (output) and rmd file used to generate the output
